First, the context tells us that Zhao Gang attended an international economic cooperation seminar in Germany. When attending such academic conferences, it's common and expected for participants to engage in meaningful discussions about the topic at hand. Option A suggests that he had in-depth discussions about economic development strategies with other participants, which is perfectly aligned with the purpose and nature of an international economic seminar. Option B about not learning basic German phrases shows poor attitude. Option C about speaking freely without following the agenda shows disrespect for conference rules. Option D about refusing to participate in group discussions demonstrates unwillingness to collaborate, which goes against the spirit of international cooperation. Option E is not applicable as we have found a suitable answer in Option A. Looking at all these choices, A is the most logical and appropriate continuation of the context, showing professional engagement and proper conference behavior. The answer is A."}
